Coordinates Field Type for BigTree CMS 4.2.10+
==============================================

This extension implements a field type for geolocating addresses.
It implements a Google Map and an address search field so that you can search for an address and further refine it by dragging and dropping a marker.

The result is saved in a JSON-encoded array with "latitude" and "longitude" keys.

This field type requires BigTree 4.2.10 or higher (it relies on an extension settings fix included in that release).
